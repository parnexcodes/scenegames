### What does this website do?
SceneGames.to aims to automate the archival and distribution of Scene game releases (PC, Mac and Linux) to various file hosts without *invasive advertisements or shady monetization practices*.

### What do you mean by Scene?
The Scene refers to an anonymous community that distributes copyrighted content (i.e. releases) such as video games, music and movies. You can learn more about it at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez_scene).

### There are so many files is there an easier way to download?
A download manager such as [JDownloader2](https://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2) will help alleviate the issue of downloading of many files. 

### I can't download from Zippyshare as I get a 404 error. How do I fix this?
Zippyshare currently has geo-blocking restrictions in place for countries located in Europe. You will need to use a VPN to bypass this.

### What do I do after I download the files?
Typically you must extract the archives (.rar file) with [WinRAR](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) or [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/). Then mount the ISO image (Windows 10 has native ISO mounting or use a program such as [WinCDEmu](https://wincdemu.sysprogs.org/)) and run the setup to install the game.

### Why is my antivirus software informing me that some files are malicious?** 
The files (i.e. crack) used to circumvent a game's DRM (Digital Rights Management) are being flagged by your anti-virus software as a false positive.

### Do you have torrents?
Yes there are magnet links, but not for all releases. Torrents are scraped from [RARBG.to](https://rarbg.to) periodically and added to the site. If you are looking for a torrent client these are highly recommended: [Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/), [qBittorent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/), and [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/).

### Why do I have to fill out captcha to view download links?
This is to prevent DMCA crawlers from scanning the site and issuing take downs at the file hosters. Also all earnings from solved captchas are donated to the [Wikimedia foundation](https://wikimediafoundation.org/).

### What if the download links do die?
Every game release found on the site is archived. There is an option to vote and have the game re-uploaded once some time passes.

### Will you upload repacks from DODI, FitGirl, etc?
No, sorry, only Scene releases and their original archives will be shared.

### Can I request games?
Yes, please contact us and provide the name of the game and the corresponding release(s). You can use a site such as [PREdb.ovh](https://predb.ovh/) to help in locating the name of a Scene game release.

### Any way I can help this site or contribute?
You can help by reporting any errors (missing links, corrupted files, site bugs, etc.) you find via our [contact form](https://scenegames.to/contact). Making others aware of this site is something else you can also do.

### What are these SFV files?
Simple file verification (SFV) is a file format that contains CRC32 check sums to verify integrity of files. The program [QuickSFV](http://www.quicksfv.org/overview.html) can aid in verifying files quickly.

### What are these NFO files?
These are text files that contain information pertaining to a release. They can be opened with a simple text editor or an application such as [iNFekt](https://infekt.ws/).

### What are these DIZ files?
Similar to NFO files, these are also text files that contain information about the content in a release.
